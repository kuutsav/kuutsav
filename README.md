### 👋 Hi, I'm Utsav

I like to build ML and Backend systems that can scale easily. Lately, most of my work has been in the domain of NLP where I am researching, building, deploying and maintaining systems in production.
 - 🔭 I'm especially interested in Information Retrieval and Recommender Systems.
 - 🌱 I'm also learning internals of python, concurrent programming using async, distributed systems, etc.
